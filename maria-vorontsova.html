Nameko employs research-based approaches to combat cancer. She gave an interview to Russia 1 (the state-owned television station). <strong>Her net worth is believed to be between</strong><b> $10 million as of November 2023. </b>She spoke about taking the initial step into the world of business.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Vorontsova earned her bachelor’s degree in biology from Saint Petersburg State University and her medical degree from Moscow State University in 2011. She was a Ph.D. candidate at the Endocrinology Research Centre in Moscow, which is directed by Dedov and administers the charity initiative Alfa-Endo for children with endocrine illnesses, with Ivan Ivanovich Dedov as her adviser. Alfa-Endo is backed by the Alfa Group’s Alfa-Bank, led by Petr Aven and Mikhail Fridman.</p><p>Vorontsova co-authored five articles between 2013 and 2015, including “The state of blood antioxidant system in individuals with active acromegaly.” She also co-wrote a book regarding idiopathic stunting in children in 2015.

Jorrit Faassen, her kind and caring spouse, is her husband. Jorrit is a wealthy businessman who rose to prominence after marrying President Vladimir Putin’s oldest daughter. He was assaulted by four bodyguards belonging to Russian financier Matvey Urin, co-owner of Trado-Bank, in November 2010. The co-owner formerly ran another bank named Breeze Bank and was connected to four other Moscow banks. Urin was taken from his employment and eventually imprisoned in Butyrka after a half-hour incident.</p><p>Not only that but he was obliged to give up all of his property, including his large holding. Maria and Jorrit Faassen lived in a penthouse atop a residential building in Voorschoten, the Netherlands. However, following the alleged instance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 being shot down by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, Dutch people called for Vorontsova’s expulsion from the nation in 2014. The couple was said to be residing in Moscow in 2015.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqqZlnq3u9Gopa2rn6uucA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmaria-vorontsova.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmaria-vorontsova.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmaria-vorontsova.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmaria-vorontsova.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmaria-vorontsova.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmaria-vorontsova.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./once-upon-a-time-2017.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./once-upon-a-time-2017.html>Once Upon a Time movie review (2017)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-google-pay-better-than-paytm.html>Is Google Pay better than Paytm?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./is-google-pay-better-than-paytm.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
