Taehyung started as The Poet Warrior Youth in 2016 and released his first independent song, self-written ‘Scenery’ in 2019. Taehyung was born Kim Tae-hyung on December 30, 1995, in the Seo District of Daegu, and grew up in Geochang County.</p><p>He is the eldest of three children, with a younger brother and sister. Taehyung first aspired to be a professional singer in elementary school. With his father’s support, he began taking saxophone lessons in early middle school as a means of pursuing a musical career. Taehyung eventually became a trainee for Big Hit Entertainment after passing an audition in Daegu.</p><p>After graduating from Korea Arts High School in 2014, Taehyung entered Global Cyber ​​University, majoring in broadcasting and entertainment, graduating in August 2020. Starting in 2021, he enrolled in Hanyang Cyber ​​University and is pursuing a master’s degree in business administration in advertising and media.</p><p>Before his debut, he was a “secret member” of BTS. Fans were unaware of his existence because his agency wanted to surprise them. He said the thought made him feel uncomfortable and lonely, thinking it was because he might be left out of the lineup. On June 13, 2013, he debuted as a member of BTS on Mnet’s M Countdown with the track “No More Dream” from his debut single 2 Cool 4 Skool.</p><p>In May 2018, Taehyung’s second solo song, “Singularity,” was released as a trailer for BTS’s then-released third studio album, “Love Yourself.” The song made its UK radio debut on BBC Radio on 25 October. A month after its release, The Guardian added “Singularity” to its “Top 50 Songs of the Month for June 2018” playlist, and Billboard placed it on its “Top 50 BTS Songs” critics list.</p><p>The Singularity was generally well received by critics, and was placed on several year-end critic lists. The New York Times ranked the song at number 20 on its list of “The 65 Best Songs of 2018”, alongside “Fake Love”. Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood named the song the fourth of the “best and most replayable songs of 2018”.</p><p>On October 24, Taehyung became one of the youngest recipients of the fifth-class Hwagwan Order of Cultural Merit medal, awarded to him by the President of South Korea along with the other members of BTS for their role in the spread of culture.

He also collaborated with bandmate Jin on the show’s soundtrack on the duet song “It’s Definitely You”. To celebrate BTS’s 4th anniversary, on June 8, 2017, Taehyung released the song “4 O’Clock,” which he co-produced with bandmate RM.</p><p>Taehyung possesses a baritone singing voice that has received a generally positive critical reception, with particular praise for his vocal range and “husky” tone. He gained wider vocal recognition for his performance of his solo song “Stigma”, and was praised for his falsettos that showed off his vocal range and unique musicality.</p><p>As a performer, Taehyung is known for his “duality”, his ability to evoke different emotions on stage. In October 2018, during the Love Yourself World Tour concert in Paris, Taehyung had difficulty singing due to an illness and had to abstain from some of his parts during the concert.
