At the time of his death on August 10, 2019, Epstein—who was known for his high-profile ties to the world’s ultra-wealthy and powerful—was awaiting trial on charges of sex-trafficking minors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following a lengthy investigation, the U.S. Justice Department’s inspector general released a report on June 27 that found <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-death-report.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="widespread negligence and mismanagement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">widespread negligence and mismanagement</a> at the now-shuttered Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan gave Epstein ample opportunity to end his own life.

The records, obtained after the AP filed a Freedom of Information Act request and released on June 1, shed new light on the exact circumstances leading to Epstein’s death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following his arrest in early July 2019, Epstein was having trouble adjusting to his prison surroundings and, at various times, was placed under observation due to possible suicidal tendencies. Epstein grew increasingly discouraged as his court case proceeded and had made an unsuccessful suicide attempt on July 23.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below is a timeline of the events from the final month of Epstein’s life. Unless otherwise stated, the information is attributed to the Federal Bureau of Prisons documents obtained by the Associated Press, including a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23832108-epstein-psych-reconstruction data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="detailed psychological reconstruction" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">detailed psychological reconstruction</a> of the circumstances prior to his death by suicide.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="body-tip css-i9osfz emevuu60">Editor’s Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or self-harming behaviors, call or text 988 to get help from the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://988lifeline.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 6:</strong> Jeffrey Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges at the Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return from Paris. He transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) New York, where he was placed in general inmate population. A facilities assistant noted Epstein appeared “distraught, sad, and a little confused” as well as “dazed and withdrawn.” She sent an email suggesting that a psychologist speak to him “just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts,” but the on-call psychologist was not contacted.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 7:</strong> After 22 hours in general population, Epstein was moved to the Manhattan prison’s Special Housing Unit (SHU) pending reclassification due to the unusual increase of media coverage and awareness of his notoriety among the inmate population.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 8: </strong>Epstein appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to his charges. Although Epstein denied suicidal thoughts and a forensic psychologist determined he didn’t have a mental illness, the psychologist recommended Epstein be preemptively evaluated for suicide risk. He was placed on psychological observation, a form of individual monitoring less restrictive than suicide watch.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 9:</strong> Epstein underwent an in-person suicide risk assessment that determined suicide watch wasn’t warranted at that time. Still, it recommended he should remain on psychological observation “out of an abundance of caution.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 10:</strong> Epstein was removed from psychological observation on July 10 and assigned to the SHU due to “risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns” related to keeping him in general population, according to a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1218466/download data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="grand jury indictment" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">grand jury indictment</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 16:</strong> Epstein made a phone call to an unknown recipient. No recordings of the call exist, and it’s unknown whether it was a legal or personal call. “Given the limited information known about Mr. Epstein, knowledge of the content of any social calls would have been crucial to helping staff work with him,” the Federal Bureau of Prisons later stated.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 18: </strong>A federal judge denies Epstein’s bail and request for pretrial release, which means he must remain in MCC New York pending his trial. “This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration,” according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which later concluded that Epstein should have received further psychological assessments to determine his mental status.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 23:</strong> Epstein attempted suicide and was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://abc7ny.com/jeffrey-epstein-death-metropolitan-correctional-center-bureau-of-prisons-how-did-die/13333224/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="found on the floor" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">found on the floor</a> of his cell with a bedsheet strip around his neck. He survived, and his injuries didn’t require hospitalization, so he was placed on suicide watch and 24-hour psychiatric observation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 24: </strong>After 31 hours, Epstein was removed from suicide watch but remained under psychological observation for several more days.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 26:</strong> On separate occasions on July 26 and 27, Epstein described himself as “a coward and as someone who does not like pain,” according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 28:</strong> Epstein complained that the toilet in his cell wouldn’t stop constantly flushing, which left him sitting in the corner of his cell with his hands over his ears. He claimed to be feeling agitated and unable to sleep at night.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 29:</strong> Epstein was removed from psychological observation on either July 29 or July 30, though there is a discrepancy as to which exact date it occurred, according to the Federal Bureau of Prison.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>July 30: </strong>Epstein was transferred back to the SHU, where he was assigned a cellmate and given the cell closest to the correction officers desk in the common area, according to a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1218466/download data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="grand jury indictment" class="body-link css-9lyfaf emevuu60">grand jury indictment</a>.
