Since Legend’s debut in the entertainment industry, many have seen the star achieve great success in his personal and professional life over the years.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>Legend is currently married to model and entrepreneur&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a>. The couple, who has been together since 2006, married in 2013 and shared two children—a daughter named Luna, 6, and a 4-year-old son named Miles. In addition to their two kids, Legend and Teigen are expecting another child. This comes years following&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Teigen’s life-saving abortion</a>&nbsp;with their son Jack after suffering pregnancy complications.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>As for his career, Legend has released eight studio albums, won 12 Grammy, an Emmy, an Oscar, and a Tony. The singer is also the first Black man to obtain EGOT status for his many contributions to the industry. Recently, he made headlines when he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ascended to top-1 percent status</a> based on his enormous wealth, so where does his net worth come from?</p><h2 id=h-brief-history data-injectable=false>Brief history</h2><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=906 data-injectable=true>Legend, also known as John Stephens, was born on Dec. 28, 1978, in Springfield, Ohio, to a seamstress named Phyllis Stephens and Ronald Stephens, a factory worker. Legend is the second oldest of three children. The “All of Me” singer’s love for the arts began early because he came from a musically inclined family. Growing up, Legend and his family were highly involved in the church. His mother would sing and direct the church choir while his father and brother played the drums. As for Legend, he sang and learned how to play the piano.</p><p data-characters=599 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>He was homeschooled on and off until high school,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would attend North High School at 12</a>&nbsp;after skipping two grades. After graduating high school at 16 years old, he left his hometown and went to the University of Pennsylvania. He would ultimately graduate from college with an English degree in 1999. That following year, Legend moved to New York and began professionally pursuing music by performing in nightclubs. During those performances, he sold his self-produced work by giving fans a copy of his CDs—”<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Stephens” and “Live at Johnny’s”</a>—in 2000 and 2001.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Also in 2001, The “Tonight” vocalist would have a life-changing encounter after meeting rapper and former friend Kanye West. Immediately following that introduction, Legend started playing the piano and singing background vocals for other artists. The list included Alicia Keys, Talib Kwali, and The Black Eyed Peas.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=770 data-injectable=true>Legend’s career started to pick up drastically in 2004 after working on West’s debut album, “College Dropout.” That same year, West launched his record label, G.O.O.D. Music, with Sony BMG, and Legend was the company’s first act. His debut album, “Get Lifted,” was released in December 2004. The record, which spawned the hit single, “Ordinary People,” earned him two Grammy awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>His musical success continued to soar as he won numerous Grammys for other albums released from 2006 to 2020. The list includes “Once Again,” “Evolver,” “Wake Up!,” “Love in the Future,” “Darkness and Light,” and “Bigger Love.” To date, Legend is reported to have sold 10 million records worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>His accomplishments didn’t stop there. The singer would go on to win a Golden Globe and an Oscar for the track, “Glory,” that he and rapper Common wrote and collaborated on for the&nbsp;Selma movie soundtrack. Legend’s other professional accolades include a Tony Award for co-producing the play,&nbsp;Jitney, and an Emmy Award for his work on the live rock rendition of&nbsp;Jesus Christ Superstar.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>Despite conflicting reports, many outlets claim that Legend is<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;worth about $100 million.</a>&nbsp;It is also reported that Legend’s net worth is a combined total with his wife, Chrissy Teigen, with the singer making the bulk of the money. Despite that, it is still being determined how much Legend’s net worth has increased since he became a coach on&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;and sold his entire music catalog.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-how-much-does-john-legend-get-paid-on-the-voice data-injectable=false>How much does John Legend get paid on ‘The Voice?’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by John Legend (@johnlegend)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true><br>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">OK! Magazine,</a>&nbsp;Legend reportedly makes $13 million per season as a coach on NBC’s&nbsp;The Voice. The reality competition series is about four professional musicians trying to mentor people they consider to have the most extraordinary voice in America and help advance their careers as artists.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Legend first joined&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;in 2019 as a replacement for Jennifer Hudson during the show’s 16th season and has been there ever since.

Despite earning a decent paycheck, Legend announced in October 2022 that he wasn’t returning for season 23, which is set to premiere sometime next year.</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>Legend told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;that the reason behind his temporary departure was the various things going on in his life. The list includes welcoming a new baby and going on tour to promote his new album, “Legend.” The 43-year-old said:</p><p>My family’s growing, I have a new album out, I’m gonna do a little bit of touring, and so it’s probably better that I take a break…but I’ll be back on&nbsp;The Voice, just not this coming season.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>John Legend’s earnings from his music</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by John Legend (@johnlegend)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>Although Legend may have sold 10 million albums globally, the total income of how much the “Green Light” songster has profited has not been made public. As for his concert revenue,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pollstar</a>&nbsp;reports that his shows would average about 4,033 ticket sales. This means that Legend could make up to $448,494 a night.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=566 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=false>In January 2022, Legend made headlines after selling his entire music catalog and royalties to BMG and KKR & Co Inc., an investment company, for an undisclosed amount.

It is reported that the music company BMG and KKR & Co Inc. own 50 percent of Legend’s music catalog dating from 2004 to 2021. Despite Legend and the companies not publicly sharing how much he profited from this deal, other artists have made hundreds of millions of dollars in the past for their catalogs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3sLTNZqOen5WjsbR5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpeceormalpZi1brTEZpyaqp6oeqe%2BzqZkraCVYsOwtcKeZJqmlGK1qr%2BMpqysoZNisrm8y5qgp52UZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-legends-net-worth-how-much-he-earns-from-the-voice-and-his-music-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-legends-net-worth-how-much-he-earns-from-the-voice-and-his-music-explained.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-legends-net-worth-how-much-he-earns-from-the-voice-and-his-music-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-legends-net-worth-how-much-he-earns-from-the-voice-and-his-music-explained.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-legends-net-worth-how-much-he-earns-from-the-voice-and-his-music-explained.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-legends-net-worth-how-much-he-earns-from-the-voice-and-his-music-explained.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kendall-jenner-bella-hadid-and-gigi-hadid-sheer-dresses-tom-ford.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kendall-jenner-bella-hadid-and-gigi-hadid-sheer-dresses-tom-ford.html>Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and Gigi Hadid Wore Totally Sheer Dresses at the Tom Ford Fashion Show</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./remnant-2-spectral-guardian-of-nerud-boss-fight-tips-html.html>Remnant 2 Spectral Guardian of NErud Boss Fight Tips</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./remnant-2-spectral-guardian-of-nerud-boss-fight-tips-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
