Although he would become controversial as the 1930s wore on, Lindbergh was still considered an American hero in March 1932. That made his son’s kidnapping a front-page story from the outset.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Read His Biography</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Charles Augustus Limbergh Jr. was taken from his crib at the family home in Hopewell, New Jersey, by a home invader at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/lindbergh-kidnapping data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="around 9 p.m." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">around 9 p.m.</a> on March 1. Lindbergh and his wife, Anne, were home at the time, relaxing downstairs under the assumption that their son was fast asleep. At about 10 p.m., the child’s nurse discovered that Charlie Jr. was missing from his crib, then frantically alerted Charles and Anne. A window next to the crib had been left open, with a ransom note left resting on the windowsill.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The poorly written letter <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/lindbergh-kidnapping/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="provided a list of demands" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">provided a list of demands</a>:</p>Dear Sir,<p>Have 50,000$ redy 25000$ in 20$ bills 15000$ in 10$ bills and 10000$ in 5$ bills.

The visitors just about wrecked the crime scene and made further retrieval of evidence impossible.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The FBI came calling on March 3, and its offer of help was far more useful.

Early on, however, Lindbergh himself was largely overseeing the process. That put him in a position to accept help from associates with connections to organized crime—they suspected some kind of mob extortion plot—and a retired school principal in the Bronx named Dr. John F. Condon who took it upon himself to get involved in the high-stakes negotiations to come.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Other Famous Abductions</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The kidnapper sent several ransom notes</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lindbergh continued to receive ransom notes from the kidnapper.

Condon, however, decided to take out an ad in a newspaper called The Bronx Home News, offering an extra $1,000 if the kidnapper used him as a go-between.</p><img alt="a post card addressed to chas linberg princeton nj that says baby safe instructions later act accordingly" title="Postcard to Charles Lindbergh" width=853 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/postcard-sent-to-lindy-hopewell-new-jersey-the-front-and-news-photo-1698697894.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>A letter sent to Charles Lindbergh after his son was kidnapped on March 1, 1932</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The bonus cash fully changed their minds, as a fourth letter sent to Lindbergh indicated that they were fine with dealing with Condon, who sent his messages through newspaper ads that employed the codename “Jafsie.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The communications soon became an exhausting wild-goose chase, with more notes indicating where to find other notes and, at one point, the kidnapper producing a piece of young Charlie’s clothing to prove that they weren’t just opportunistic liars. Finally, after a series of in-person meetings in an upper Manhattan cemetery and letter exchanges that took them to the twelfth ransom note and brought the price down to $50,000, Condon handed over the cash and was told that the baby could be found in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, on a boat called the Nellie.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Charlie Jr. was nowhere to be found.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A tragic discovery near Lindbergh’s home turned the case into a long-running mystery</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On May 12, 1932, a little over a month after the disappointment in Massachusetts and 72 days after the baby first went missing, Charlie Jr.’s badly decimated body was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/body-charles-lindbergh-baby-found-hopewell-1932-article-1.2632021 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="found alongside a highway near the Lindbergh estate" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">found alongside a highway near the Lindbergh estate</a>. The body was burned, partly decomposed, missing limbs, and there was a hole drilled into its crushed skull.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It was as if some adult person had held the baby tightly in his arms and deliberately hammered the head with the purpose of causing instant death,” New Jersey State Police Chief H. Norman Schwarzkopf wrote in a statement about the discovery. The New York Daily News, one of a dozen New York–based newspapers covering the story at the time, used the injuries to inform speculation about the kidnapper’s motives.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Although it was possible that the abduction and murder were spite work, it seemed more likely that the kidnapers, observing from this lookout point that the alarm was spreading from the Lindbergh home, became frightened, killed their small prisoner and fled,” the newspaper’s report <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/body-charles-lindbergh-baby-found-hopewell-1932-article-1.2632021 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=read class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">read</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The vast national interest in the case and priority put on it first by Hoover, then by President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/franklin-d-roosevelt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Franklin D.

In doing so, he issued an executive order that recalled all gold coins and certificates worth more than $100, ordering that they be returned to the U.S. government. Every gold certificate had its own serial number that allowed the government to track which had been returned to the Federal Reserve—including the notes given to the person who demanded the ransom for the Lindbergh baby.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">There were false alarms here, too, but ultimately, in the summer of 1934, there were 16 gold certificates <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822104155/http:/www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Hauptmann/AccountHauptmann.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="spent in places" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">spent in places</a> in and around Manhattan’s Upper East Side. This was significant because the neighborhood was at the time a major enclave of German immigrants and their first-generation descendants, and the handwriting on the ransom notes all suggested to experts that they were written by someone from Germany who spoke limited English.</p><img alt="bruno hauptmann sits on a chair in handcuffs and a suit" title="Bruno Hauptmann was convicted of kidnapping and murdering the Lindbergh baby" width=2044 height=2534 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/at-the-greenwich-street-police-station-bruno-hauptmann-main-news-photo-1698698539.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Bruno Hauptmann was linked to the Lindbergh baby kidnapping after using a recalled gold certificate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One such certificate had a license plate number written on it, the result of a clerk being suspicious of the person who handed it to him. The note was ultimately traced back to Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a German immigrant who offered a lame story about inheriting the notes from a friend who had died. An investigation discovered more of the gold notes hidden in his garage and Dr. Condon’s phone number, which was more than enough to charge him with a crime.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The trial was a media circus</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A record 700 reporters rushed to Flemington, New Jersey, at the start of 1935, ready for what was to be a sensational trial.

For the first time, Americans were able to watch an intense a high-powered criminal trial in almost real-time.
