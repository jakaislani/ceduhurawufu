Therefore, most strict recommendations indicate that you should not drink more than one can of soda a week.<h2>What soda is best?</h2><p>Here are the Top 10 Best Sodas:</p><ul><li>Coca-Cola.</li><li>Dr. Pepper.</li><li>Sprite.</li><li>Mountain Dew.</li><li>A&W Root Beer.</li><li>7 Up.</li><li>Orange Crush.</li><li>Cherry Coke Cherry Pepsi came in 31st.</li></ul><h2>What was the first soda?</h2>Dr Pepper was created in 1885 and believed to be the first soda as we know it today followed by Coca-Cola one year later. The story doesn't end there; there have been many modifications to the way soda has been enjoyed between its invention and today.<h2>What do northerners call soda?</h2>Soda is the preferred term in the Northeast, most of Florida, California, and pockets in the Midwest around Milwaukee and St. Louis.

Now across the U.S. the answer is pretty mixed, but Chicago and most of northern Illinois, use "pop," while the rest of the state say "soda."<h2>Why do Southerners call all soda coke?</h2>Regional terminology<p>"Coke" became a generic term in the south because it was the first widely popular soft drink and it wasdefinitively southern.
